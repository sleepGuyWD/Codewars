Welcome to my Codewars repository where I display my discipline to solving code challenges on a daily basis. You will see my solutioins along with their respective challenge commented above within each JS file.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Everyday, depending on my current schedule, I attempt to solve at least ONE Codewars Challenge in Javascript.  Juggling a full-time job, while learning to program is not an easy task, but completing these challenges really helps get the ball rolling into a study session.  Many solutions are applicable to real world solutions at times, and I think it is awesome that Codewars provides a medium for you to test your knowledge.

## Optimizations

I have attempted to refactor each challenge while working through them.  Although, the least lines may not always indicate the "best solution", I have attempted each challenge with the goal of simplifying a solution with the highest level of efficiency.

## Lessons Learned:

I started learning Javascript towards the end of Sept. 2022.  I have learned that in order to solve coding challenges, you MUST manage your frustrations.  Some problems will be much easier than others, but you must push through in order to reach that solution.  There are some challenges where you will need to review the solutions after a failed attempt.  It is okay to do this, because you can learn from others' solutions.   It is important to note these failures, because they ultimately lead to future success.
